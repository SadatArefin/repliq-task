# Repliq Task

## Task Overview

Suppose, You have been hired as a developer for a project where you would create a web application for an e-commerce admin using ReactJS and NextJS.
There are a few views in the app

1. Login & Home/Landing View
   a. Register View
2. Product List View / Product Detail View
3. Cart View / Checkout View
   a. Delete Product from Cart
4. Admin Dashboard / Overview / Summary
5. Admin Customers List / Customer Detail View
   a. Add Customer
6. Admin Order List / Admin Order Detail View
7. Admin Product List / Product Detail View
   a. Add Product

Pick at least five of the above view pairings.
Develop fully clickable and browsable flows.
Use Tailwind v3+ to code the user interface. Use
open-source user interface kits.

## Requirements & Standards

- A user registers in using a special Bangladeshi phone number and password during registration; they use the same information to obtain a JWT and then log in to the app.
- The primary method of storing the data will be to retrieve it from the backend; however, at this time, we are not concentrating on API calls. If you wish to completely bypass that step, you may hardcode the data as JSON into the code. Alternatively, you can serve the JSON via Github pages and make axios/fetch requests.

## What will be graded

- Your familiarity with ReactJS's fundamental ideas (components, hooks, data fetching and stores, HOCs, layouts etc)
- Your familiarity with UI/UX principles
- Your capacity to produce comprehensible code
- Your capacity to create a ReactJS project with well defined components that makes sense in this project's environment.
- Your comprehension of fundamental Javascript/ReactJS principles and concepts
- Your capacity to use and comprehend best practices where appropriate
- Your capacity to use and comprehend best practices where appropriate
- Your ability to express intention Your comments and code
- Your skill to write intelligibly and clearly Github updates
- Your knowledge of the tools, libraries, and ecosystem around ReactJS
- The accuracy of your judgments and your decisions
- Your time spent figuring out this issue

Bonus points (NOT mandatory)

- Your JSON lists should be stored in a remote repository like S3 or a backend server of your choice, and you should use Axios or comparable frameworks to get the data.
- Add a login view and a registration view with basic login and registration forms after finishing all 6 views.

GUIDELINES

- For this test, you don't need to create any backend code.
- Instead of writing a fully working web application for this test, the goal is to see how You analyze the requirements to create skeleton/minimal feasible code that is appealing and has excellent UX/UI.
- If the open source tools that are easily accessible online are used correctly, we think someone with a year's worth of daily experience with ReactJS could do this work in around 5 or 6 hours.
- You don't have to copy the user interface from the mockups and have flawless pixels. It's crucial that we get that if you have a solid understanding of UX/UI, you can build the project.

What you are permitted to do

- Use any open source third-party libraries of your choosing, and be sure to specify them in the package.json and README.md files. If you've ever used something that isn't open source
- Utilize the free online UI kits that are open source.
- Use your own code that you wrote in another project.

What you are not permitted to do

- Ask questions because this is not a classroom environment and people from different time zones will ultimately take this test. Question-asking privileges will provide certain people an unfair edge, which will distort evaluations and outcomes.

Submission and Final Grading

- When finished, push the project to a public Github repository.
- The project is published to a live Vercel or Netlify URL.
- The grading will take into account both the timestamps and the commits.
- A significant portion of the effort is writing clear commit messages.
- You will earn more points the faster you work and the more thoughtful/granular your commit remarks are.
- If you think it would be helpful for the person evaluating your code, you can add a few notes as comments to the code to clarify your choices and reasons.
- Send an email from the email address you used to take the quiz, along with a link to your Github public repository, to jobs@repliq.dev to share your submission.
